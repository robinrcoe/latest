Block Quotes
------------

Block quotes consist of indented body elements:

    My theory by A. Elk.  Brackets Miss, brackets.  This theory goes
    as follows and begins now.  All brontosauruses are thin at one
    end, much much thicker in the middle and then thin again at the
    far end.  That is my theory, it is mine, and belongs to me and I
    own it, and what it is too.

Tables
------

Here's a grid table followed by a simple table:

+------------------------+------------+----------+----------+
| Header row, column 1   | Header 2   | Header 3 | Header 4 |
| (header rows optional) |            |          |          |
+========================+============+==========+==========+
| body row 1, column 1   | column 2   | column 3 | column 4 |
+------------------------+------------+----------+----------+
| body row 2             | Cells may span columns.          |
+------------------------+------------+---------------------+
| body row 3             | Cells may  | - Table cells       |
+------------------------+ span rows. | - contain           |
| body row 4             |            | - body elements.    |
+------------------------+------------+----------+----------+
| body row 5             | Cells may also be     |          |
|                        | empty: ``-->``        |          |

An example::

      Whitespace, newlines, blank lines, and all kinds of markup
        (like *this* or \this) is preserved by literal blocks.
    Lookie here, I've dropped an indentation level
    (but not far enough)

  no more example
